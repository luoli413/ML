It's a machine learning final project.
Topic:stocks return prediction by fundamental data
I wrote a simple-version back-test framework to test machine learning models:linear and non-linear.

All the infrastructure are done in utils.py.
Models are wrote in model fucntion in strategy.py.
The next step is to add stoploss and delta hedging strategy and so on.
